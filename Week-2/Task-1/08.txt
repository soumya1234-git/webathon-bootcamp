How many loops are there in JavaScript,how do they work?
JavaScript provides several types of loops for iterating over data and executing repeated tasks.
1.for Loop:
Used when you know how many times to run the loop.
syntax:
for(initialization;condition checking;increment){
    code to execute
}
2.while Loop:
Used when you don't know in advance how many times to loop.
syntax:
while(condition){
    code to execute
}
3.do..while Loop:
Similar to while,but ensures the loop  runs at least once,even if the condition is false.
syntax:
do{
    code to execute
}while(condition);
