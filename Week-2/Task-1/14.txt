What are Functions in JavaScript,and how do you declare them?
A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.Functions help in organizing code,improving reusability,and making the program more readable and 
manageable.
There are several ways to declare a function in JavaScript:
1.Function Declaration
This function can be called using greet();
2.Function Expression
The function is stored in a variable and can be called using greet();
3.Arrow Function
This is more concise way of writing functions.
4.Immediately Invoked Function Expression
This function executes immediately after being defined.
