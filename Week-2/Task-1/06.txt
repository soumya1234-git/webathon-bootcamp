Explain the difference between var,let and const in JavaScript?
 
1.var(Function-scoped)
var is function-scoped,meaning it is only accessible within the function 
where it is declared.It can be redeclared and updated within the same scope.
It gets hoisted to the top of its scope but is initialized with undefined.
2.let(Block-scoped)
let is block-scoped,meaning it is only accessible within the block{} where it is declared. It can be updated,but not redeclared within the same scope.It is hoisted but not initialized,meaning using it before declaration results in an error.
3.const(Block-scoped,Immutable)
const is block-scoped like let.It cannot be updated or redeclared.However,if assigned to an object or array,the properties/elements can be changed.
