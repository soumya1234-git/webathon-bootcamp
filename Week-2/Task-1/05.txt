Explain difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
Null and undefined both represents the absence of a value, but they have different meanings and behaviors.
1.undefined:
A variable is undefined when it has been declared but not assigned a value.
Functions return undefined if they don't explicitly return a value.Accessing an object 
property that doesn't exist returns undefined.
2.null:
null is an explicit assignment to indicate that a variable has "no value".
It is commonly used when you want to clear a value or signal the intentional absence of an object.
