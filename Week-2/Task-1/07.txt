What is callback function,and why is it important in JavaScript?
A callback funcion is a function that is passed as an argument to another 
function and is executed later,usually after some asynchronous operation has
been completed.
Why are Callaback Functions Important?
1.Asynchronous programming:
Callback allow javascript to handle operations like fetching data from an API,reading files,or setting timers without blocking the execution of other code.
2.Modular Code:
Callbacks promote reusability and modularity,making code more maintainable.
3.Event Handling:
Javascript heavily relies on callbacks for handling events,like user
clicks or keyboard input.
